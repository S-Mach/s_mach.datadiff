+s_mach.datadiff+ is an open-source data differencing engine for Scala. 
Implementations of the +DataDiff+ type-class are provided which can compute the 
difference between data types, +Set+, +Seq+, +Map+, case classes, tuples and any
other type that can be represented as a +struct type+. The difference between 
any two instances is stored as a +patch type+, which can be user-defined. 
Patches can also be applied later to another instance to propagate computed 
changes. All provided +DataDiff+ implementations are 100% strongly-typed and use
 absolutely no runtime reflection. Also, the macro-based +mkDataDiff+ method is 
 provided which can automatically create a +DataDiff+ implementation for any 
 case class or other type that can be represented as a +struct type+.
 
== Include in SBT
1. Add to +build.sbt+
+
[source,sbt,numbered]
----
libraryDependencies += "net.s_mach" %% "datadiff" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
----
NOTE: +s_mach.datadiff+ is currently only compiled for Scala 2.11 (though 2.10.4
support can be added if there is interest)

== Versioning
+s_mach.datadiff+ uses semantic versioning (http://semver.org/).
+s_mach.datadiff+ does not use the package private modifier. Instead, all code
files outside of the +s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package form the public interface
and are governed by the rules of semantic versioning. Code files inside the
+s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package may be used by downstream applications and
libraries. However, no guarantees are made as to the stability or interface of
code in the +s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package between versions.


== Imports for Examples
