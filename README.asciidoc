+s_mach.datadiff+ is an open-source Scala library that provides the +DataDiff+
type-class which can compute the difference between data types, +Set+, +Seq+,
+Map+, case classes, tuples and any other type that can be represented as a
+struct type+. The difference between any two instances is stored as a
+patch type+ (which can be user-defined). Using the +DataDiff+ type-class the
can be applied to another instance to propagate the  computed changes. All
+DataDiff+ implementations are 100% strongly-typed and use absolutely no runtime
reflection. The +mkDataDiff+ method is provided which can automatically create
an implementation of +DataDiff+ for any case class or other class that can be
represented as a +struct type+.

== Include in SBT
1. Add to +build.sbt+
+
[source,sbt,numbered]
----
libraryDependencies += "net.s_mach" %% "datadiff" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
----
NOTE: +s_mach.datadiff+ is currently only compiled for Scala 2.11 (though 2.10.4
support can be added if there is interest)

== Versioning
+s_mach.datadiff+ uses semantic versioning (http://semver.org/).
+s_mach.datadiff+ does not use the package private modifier. Instead, all code
files outside of the +s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package form the public interface
and are governed by the rules of semantic versioning. Code files inside the
+s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package may be used by downstream applications and
libraries. However, no guarantees are made as to the stability or interface of
code in the +s_mach.datadiff.impl+ package between versions.


== Imports for Examples
